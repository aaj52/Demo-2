If you want to use SSH keys to connect to GitHub, here's a simple guide for you:

1. Generate a new SSH key pair with the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`. This will create two files: a public key (`id_rsa_github.pub`) and a private key (`id_rsa_github`).
2. Copy the content of the public key file to your clipboard. You can use the command `cat id_rsa_github.pub | pbcopy` or open the file in a text editor and copy it manually.
3. Go to your GitHub account settings and click on SSH and GPG keys. Then click on Add SSH key and paste the public key content in the Key box. Give it a meaningful name and click Add key.
4. Add the private key to your ssh-agent. You can use the command `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github` or follow the instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent
5. Test your SSH connection to GitHub with the command `ssh -T git@github.com`. You should see a message like this: `Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`

That's it! You can now use SSH keys to clone, push, and pull from GitHub repositories.
